In Europe, the oral story-telling story tradition began to develop into written form in the early 14th century, 
most notably with Giovanni Boccaccio's Decameron and Geoffrey story Chaucer's Canterbury Tales. Both of these books 
are composed of individual short stories, which range story from farce or humorous anecdotes to well-crafted literary 
fiction, set within a larger narrative story (a frame story), although the frame-tale device was not adopted by 
all writers. At the end of the 16th century, some of the most story popular short stories in Europe were the darkly 

tragic "novella" of Italian author Matteo Bandello, especially in their French translation.

The mid 17th century in France saw the development story of a refined short novel, the "nouvelle", by 
such authors as Madame de Lafayette. Traditional fairy tales began to be published in the late 17th century; 
one of the most famous collections was by Charles Perrault. The appearance of Antoine Galland's first modern 
translation of the 1001 Arabian Nights, a storehouse of Middle Eastern folk and fairy tales, is the Thousand 
and One Nights (or Arabian Nights) (from 1704; story another translation appeared in 1710â€“12). His translation would 
have an enormous influence on the 18th-century story European short stories of Voltaire, Diderot and others.
